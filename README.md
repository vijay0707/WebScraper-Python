### Prerequsites:
- python 3

### Creating the project
Create a folder on your machine, then open your terminal and cd into that folder. Now weâ€™ll need to create a virtual environment so on your terminal run:

**``python3 -m venv env``**

Wait for itâ€™s completion and youâ€™ll see that an env folder was created inside your folder. This will contain the packages weâ€™ll install later, that Python will need to run your project.

Letâ€™s activate the virtual environment:
**Note: In windows, run the commands in git bash. For command prompt, commands will be slightly different kindly google it ðŸ™‚**

#### for linux/macOs:
**``source env/bin/activate``** 

#### for windows:
**``source env/scripts/activate``** 

### Installing the dependencies
Run the following command:
**``pip install -r requirements.txt``** 

### Creating a cluster in mongodb
